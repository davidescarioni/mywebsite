This is my little corner into the web! I made this website while I'm studying **ReactJS** and **GatsbyJS**: the first one is one of the most popular Javascript library of the web that is used to develop *Single Page Application*, instead the second one is a Javascript Framework based on React that is used to develop Static Website with *terrific* performance. If you would like to see the source code of this web page you can click [here](https://github.com/davidescarioni/mywebsite).

## Who am I?
Oh sorry, I forget to introduce myself! My name is (obviously) Davide Scarioni, also known as **Scario** by real and online friends. I'm a FrontEnd developer during the day and an Indie Games Developer (wannabe xD) in my spare time. I usually develop in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, **Freemarker** and **React** for work, while I use **GML** for Game Development: for who doesn't know, GML is the language of [Game Maker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/). I am a longtime member of [GMItalia](https://gmitalia.altervista.org/), the wonderful Italian community of Game Maker, and this is why most of the projects shown here are videogames.
